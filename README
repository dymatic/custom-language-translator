The NCLT, Noran Custom Language Translator, is a program that
can read a langdefines file to translate code back and forth.

The repository comes with a langdefines for my own language,
NRSL.

When you run the program you need to specify the langdefines file,
which uses the old_new syntax, the code, an output file, and a 
magichar. The magichar is used for sensitive strings, which are
things you do not want translated. You put it in between two magichars.

The program will translate according to langdefines and nothing else.
For instance, if you set "||_or" in the langdefines and wrote "tore"
it would translate into "t||e", so you should put everything of the 
sort in between two magichars. I use "$" as my magichar.

There are serveral new features present in version 2. The langdefines
is commentable with TWO $ characters. Not using two will cause the 
program to crash. Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use "$"
in either the original or the product (sorry Bash scripters!)
CHANGELOG
1 - The proejct works.
2 - Comments, sanitization, and two running modes.
PLANS
I want to add some newline handling to the langdefines.
