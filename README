The NCLT, Noran Custom Language Translator, is a program that
can read a langdefines file to translate code back and forth.

The repository comes with a langdefines for my own language,
NRSL.

When you run the program you need to specify the langdefines file,
which uses the old_new syntax, the code, an output file, and a 
magichar. The magichar is used for sensitive strings, which are
things you do not want translated. You put it in between two magichars.

The program will translate according to langdefines and nothing else.
For instance, if you set "||_or" in the langdefines and wrote "tore"
it would translate into "t||e", so you should put everything of the 
sort in between two magichars. I use "$" as my magichar.

CHANGELOG
1 - The proejct works.
2 - Upon request I added non-interactive mode. Call it with [program] path_to_langdefines path_to_code path_to_output magichar

PLANS
I want to add some more features for langdefine parsing, like
in-file comment and newline handling.
